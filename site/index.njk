        <h2 class="heading-beta">Getting started</h2>

        <p>Getting started with web projects is as easy as adding the following CSS reference to your project, as well as deploying font files to a <code>/fonts</code> directory on the web server. Licenced font files can be included with any project that is sponsored by BUNN&reg; or hosted at bunn.com.
